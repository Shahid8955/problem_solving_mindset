# Task 7
# Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)
## Objective
- Control program flow based on conditions using if, elif, and else.
```python
# Example 
if condition:
    # Execute this block if condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # Execute if previous condition was False, but this one is True
else:
    # Execute if all above conditions are False
```
# Best Practices:
- Conditions ko clear aur structured rakho.
- Efficiency badhane ke liye multiple if statements ki jagah elif ka use karo.
- Clean output formatting ke liye f-strings ka use karo.
